# create a minikube cluster with two nodes or more `minikube start -p demo --nodes 2`
# apply this deployment without affinity and check the pods are scheduled on both nodes
# apply this deployment with affinity and check the pods are pending because no nodes have the label `gpu`
# apply the label to one of the nodes `kubectl label node demo-m02 gpu=true` and check the pods are scheduled on that node
# now you should use taint and toleration to avoid other pods to be scheduled on that node, because it's a GPU node and should be reserved only for pods that needs GPU
# command to remove the label: `kubectl label node demo-m02 gpu-`
