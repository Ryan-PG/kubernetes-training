# try node selector
# look at the init container when you start the pod
# get a shell and select which container to go to
# check env variables inside the main container



# For doing `initContainers` every a specific time, you must use cron jobs and make a contatiner for soing some stuffs.
# Also for accessibility use service accounts in kubernetes.
